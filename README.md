Final Project from Global Change science: Analytics with R emphasizing the effect of global surface temperature on endangered species

### Title: Annual Surface Temperature Change Effects on Endangered Species

**Aim**: I aim to explore how climate change affects endangered species throughout the world. I am interested in studying how trends in global warming, specifically annual surface temperature change, impact endangered species. I plan to compare yearly climate change trends with the number of endangered species on the Red List from 1996 to 2022. Hsiung and Sunstein (2007) mention that the current effects of climate change have already impacted animal life substantially (p. 1696). On a more governmental approach to this issue, Rhul (2008) explores what actions the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) should take to support the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (p. 13). Unfortunately, as of 2019, agency plans remained inadequate in relation to conservation of US endangered species according to Delach, Caldas, Edson, et al. (p. 999). I will also perform a study of the correlation between annual surface temperature change per country with the top ten countries with the most endangered species (as of 2019). For this project, I aim to answer the general question: “how does climate change impact endangered species?”. 

**Scope and System**: The scope of the analysis will be conducted globally by studying global climate change patterns as well as globally threatened species. The system will examine the interactions between annual changes in surface temperature and number of endangered species. The project will primarily focus on climate change and the number of endangered species on the Red List from 1996 to 2022 per year, as well as how surface temperature changes in each country affect the number of endangered species in the ten countries with the most endangered species as of 2019.

**Methods**: Data was collected from existing datasets found on the Internet. Data has been found on the IMF climate change dashboard for annual surface temperature change from 1961 to 2022 per country. Endangered species data (“Number of endangered species on the Red List from 1996 to 2022”) has been collected by the Statista Research Department to examine the relationship between climate change and the number of endangered species. These data sets were joined on the basis of year. The figures in the project displayed different global warming trends as well as their relationship with the number of endangered species on the Red List. Using the same dataset for annual surface temperature change  as well as the dataset “Counties with the most endangered species 2019,” a study of the correlation between climate change trends per country and the number of endangered species per country was able to be conducted. These datasets were joined on the basis of country to compare the relationship between climate change trends and the number of endangered species per country for ten countries.

**Results**: The expected result was to find that there is a direct relationship between the number of endangered species in comparison to climate change; such that as annual surface temperatures increase, the number of endangered species will increase as well. 
Main Conclusions: The main conclusions expected to be seen are that the number of endangered species increases as surface temperatures increase. This study will benefit government agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other agencies interested in the preservation of endangered animal species. These interactions can be studied more closely in the future by focusing on a particular geographic area and the types of endangered species located there. There is no singular solution to global warming, however in order for certain species to remain existent on Earth, something must be done to slow climate change.
